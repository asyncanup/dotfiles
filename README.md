# dotfiles

To use this setup locally, install [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm), and run

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/asyncanup/dotfiles
```

To install all the goodness like fzf, rg, etc and set everything up to work together on Ubuntu, run:

```bash
$HOME/.config/yadm/bootstrap
```

Better to do this in a cloud machine or inside a docker container so you don't accidentally mess your local settings up.
Better still to just read what `.config/yadm/bootstrap` does!
